# Supervised Learning Final

## Overview

This repository is my final project for CU Boulder's CSCA 5622: Supervised Learning course. I demonstrate the application of supervised learning techniques for classification tasks. The project is structured around Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Secondary Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+datase), a simulated dataset for binary classification into edible and poisonous mushrooms. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository using the `ucimlrepo` package.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to:

1. Explore the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing.
2. Build and evaluate various supervised learning models for classification.
3. Compare model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
4. Summarize findings and discuss the challenges and insights gained during the project.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/porterwilcox/supervised-learning.git
   cd supervised-learning
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   # On Windows:
   env\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

1. Open Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
2. Explore the supervised-learning notebook to view the analysis, modeling, and results.
